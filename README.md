# Renovara-Spirit-of-a-Higher-Order# Renovara: Spirit of a Higher Order
An SNES assembly project which displays a series of Mode 1 images of an AI-generated spirit of harmony, purification, reconciliation, and protection converted using superfamiconv.

It is coded to use the WLA-DX assembler, and has only been tested under Linux. There is a bash script to assemble and link the files, one which launches "bsnes" with the result, and one that doesn't. Be careful, if there is an error, an old version of the ROM may be launched and appear without changes. It has been tested on a real SNES using an FXPak Pro.
